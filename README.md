# LAP 1 Debugging Assignment

Welcome to your first debugging assignment!
This repo is riddled with bugs and poor practices... we need your help to fix it up.
You may add/refactor file structure as you deem appropriate.
Please make sure that you **read all the instructions before starting**.


### Code of Conduct
- Do not ask your classmates (verbally or through any other communication method) for help.
- You may, of course, use online documentation. Do not, however, copy any code from someone else or from any online resource.

## Tasks
You are going to debug and complete a Random Quotes generator. When you are finished with the app, it should look something like this:

### Server
- Install the node modules and get your api server running
- Use the comments in `app.js` to add the missing routes and improve the `/quotes/:id` route
- NB: Look carefully at the gif to ensure you are returning the expected data.

### Client
- Edit title and button using CSS and HTML so that it looks similar to the one in the gif (don't worry about exact colour or font size). Include at least one external font.
- Change the background image and add image credits in the bottom right-hand corner of the page. Note this can be an image of your choice, you do not need to source the exact same image.
- Clean up any repetitive or unneeded code
- Debug script.js so that a random quote is shown every time the button is clicked

### README
- Add a useful README to document your work, take a look at [this guide](https://gist.github.com/getfutureproof-admin/dfe45adba508f931bf83d144cbbf6bbe) on assignment specific requirements.
